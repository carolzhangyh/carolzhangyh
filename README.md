#Markdown is very fast.


#Description:This is an example for sombining strings. We always use the code "str_c" to combine two strings. For instance, if we want to combine two strings, we can then write it like "str_c(mystrings[1],mystrings[2])". Besides if we want to seperate two strings with a comma, we can write it like "str_c(mystrings[1],mystrings[2],sep(,))".#
