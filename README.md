#Markdown is very fast.


#Description:This is an example for combining strings.


#Instruction:The first step is to define somethings in out string, such as "mystrings<-("one apple","two apple","red apple","small apple")". We always use the code "str_c" to combine two strings. For instance, if we want to combine two strings, we can then write it like "str_c(mystrings[1],mystrings[2])". Besides if we want to seperate two strings with a comma, we can write it like "str_c(mystrings[1],mystrings[2],sep(,))".
